It is not uncommon for computer users to acknowledge the utmost importance of their keyboard. After all, the keyboard remains one of the earliest adopted hardware tools (even before the trackpad or mouse) and has remained largely unchanged in its core functionality over the past several decades. But, keyboard problems can come as a shock, especially when computer users realize how difficult their movements are when a functional keyboard is not present. With that in mind, learning how to unlock the keyboard can be an incredibly important prospect.

## Unlocking a Dell Keyboard: Basics

In order to begin unlocking your Dell keyboard, first assess some key issues which, though simple to fix, may be causing the problem in question. For example, if you're using a wireless keyboard, the locking issue may be caused by dead batteries. With that in mind, take a moment to check the batteries in your wireless keyboard and replace as needed.

Yet another common cause for a locked keyboard is activated "Num Lock" or "Scroll Lock" keys. Although neither of these keys could cause your entire keyboard to be locked, they may cause specific elements of your keyboard to stop functioning. With that in mind, make sure both of these keys are deactivated when diagnosing your specific keyboard problems.
